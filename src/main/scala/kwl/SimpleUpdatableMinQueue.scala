/**
 * A basic Priority Queue with Updatable Priorities.
 *
 * this is a min-queue, i.e. de-queueing returns the min-weight element
 *
 * Note: a more efficient queue implementation with better decreaseKey is possible,
 * but surely not needed for this task (at least until nodes are named as letters!)
 *
 * Note: a faster but more complex Priority Queue implementing DecreaseWeight would require:
 * - a reverse index of where physically each entry is stored in the heap (to find it quickly)
 *     * e.g. Array for low number of elements, or a HashTable for more fancy types  O(1)
 * - once found the required heap entry, modify it and shiftUp/down O(log n)
