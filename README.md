Installation
----------------------------
The only prerequisite is ```sbt```, the [Scala Build Tool](www.scala-sbt.org). 
Sbt will take care of all the dependencies, will compile and allow running the code and  tests easily. 
  
When you run any ```sbt``` command, it  will automatically recompile the modified code if needed.

Running the tests and code-checks
----------------------------
```bash
# run the main (covering items from the assignment and printing the results)
sbt run

# run the tests (sample output from assignment and randomized scalacheck tests)
sbt test

# stylecheck
sbt scalastyle
```

Code Structure
----------------------------
The Main code is in [src/main/scala/kwl/](src/main/scala/kwl/) containing the following files:

 * ```Kiwiland``` - the entry point (which mixes in the functionality below)
 * ```Graph``` - a simple adjacency-list based graph
 * ```RouteDist``` - simply calculates the distance of a given route
 * ```ShortestPath``` - implements 1) Floyd-Warshall and 2) Dijkstra based on min-queue
 * ```TripsCounter``` - a basic recursive counter of different routes available 
     (two versions, one with dynamic-programing-like result caching/memo)
 * ```utils/```
   - ```utils/SimpleUpdatableMinQueue``` - basic updatable min-queue on top of scala's Scala's HashSet
     * *Note: for better performance an adapted minHeap shall be used, which would keep track of the physical location of each entry in the heap*
   - ```utils/Memo``` - a basic generic Memo "decorator" (7 lines of beautiful external code)     

Tests
----------------------------
The tests are contained in [src/test/scala/](src/test/scala/):
 
 * ```TestSuite``` contains the unit tests based on:
     - sample output from the assignment
     - running a large number of randomized tests based on arbitrary inputs generated with help of the [ScalaCheck](www.scalacheck.org) lib (details below)
 * ```CheckShortestPath`` - for a number of arbitrary graphs, ensures that results by the two Shortest-Path algorithms are the same for all pairs of nodes  
 * ```GraphGenerator``` - generates random arbitrary graphs
 * ```CheckUpdatableMinQueue``` - generates random priority queues and checks that findMin and updatePriority methods work correctly
 * ```CheckTripsCounter``` - for each random graph check that the results of different implementations match

Note: in a more serious project, additionally, code coverage should be checked, e.g. with sbt-scoverage. 
Anyway, it seems these sbt plugins might be slightly outdated in the repositories and are not easily resolved by sbt.
