/**
 * At first sight it might look that bruteforce enumeration of all possible paths could be the only
 * feasible solution. Happily, if cycles in the paths are allowed (and they are), dynamic programming
 * comes to help, based on an observation that the # of different sub-routes from s to dest (s -> dest)
 * depend only on (s, dest, dist) independently of any steps taken earlier. This guarantees
 * polynomial runtime (at the expense of a small additional storage).
 *
 * Note that there are two related problems: first, on acyclic graphs the solution is really simple:
 * count paths while walking in a topological order [3, 4]. On the other hand, finding # of simple
 * paths (i.e. acyclic) in a cyclic graph is P-complete [1-2,5], where, approximations are sometimes
 * preferred.
 *
 * Below is a simple recursive solution covering the Dynamic Programing idea via caching/memento.
 *
 * Its complexity shall be ~ O(|N| * |E| * |Dist|) and uses storage of O(N Dist).
 * This might be theoretically improved by organizing the computations in other way, but certainly is
 * better than the naive bruteforce.
 *
 * TODO: get rid of recursion to support much larger graphs
